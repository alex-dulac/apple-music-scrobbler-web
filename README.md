# Scrobbler Web App

### For use with [py-scrobbler](https://github.com/alex-dulac/py-scrobbler)

#### The reasons for this project:
- I don't really like LastFM's Desktop App. I doubt that it is maintained or updated these days and it's UI is a little archaic.
- I want to see more of my LastFM data in regard to the current song that's playing.
- Typically, I listen to music via the Apple Music desktop app, or Spotify's browser app.
- This app allows me to scrobble from either and get data on the fly from LastFM.
- I realize this is a particularly specific use case, but I hope someone else might benefit from something in here as well.
