# Apple Music Scrobbler Web App

### For use with [Apple Music Scrobbler API](https://github.com/alex-dulac/apple-music-scrobbler)

#### The reasons for this project:
- I don't really like LastFM's Desktop App. I doubt that it is maintained or updated these days and it's UI is a little archaic.
- I want to see more of my LastFM data in regards to the current song that's playing.
- Apple Music is my go-to music streaming app, which I typically use on a day to day basis.
- Eventually I'd like to integrate to Spotify's API for a similar experience.
